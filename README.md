# Credit_Risk_Modeling
Development of credit risk modeling, using studies such as PD (Probability of Default), LGD (Loss Given Default) and EAD (Exposure at Default), to obtain the expected loss (EL). Using models such as logistic regression and linear regression, as well as data preparation studies and exploratory data analysis. 
In addition to the other studies:
- Weight of evidence
- Information value
- Fine classing
- Coarse classing
- Linear regression
- Logistic regression
- Area Under the Curve
- Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
- Gini Coefficient
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov
- Assessing Population Stability
- Maintaining a model
